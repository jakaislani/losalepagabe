This iteration of Cactus Jack wasn't yet a fleshed-out creation, but after a stint as Cactus Jack Manson, in which he played off the serial-killer vibe of notorious cult leader <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/charles-manson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Manson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Manson</a>, Foley funneled some of the creepier elements into the sadist who turbocharged the World Championship Wrestling and Eastern Championship Wrestling promotions in the 1990s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with his signature "Bang bang!" catchphrase, Cactus Jack became known for wielding barbed-wire bats in his increasingly bloody appearances, seemingly reaching the limit when a botched maneuver vs. Big Van Vader in Munich, Germany, resulted in his right ear being torn off. But the incident did little to dampen Foley's taste for violence, and he found the ideal showcase for his talents by surviving the beating, burning and bludgeoning featured at IWA Japan's "King of the Death Match" tournament in 1995.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although he seemingly left Cactus Jack behind after moving to WWE shortly afterward, Foley later donned the old "Wanted: Dead" t-shirt and slipped back into the character when pushed to the breaking point by overzealous opponents, including Triple H in 2000 and Randy Orton in 2004.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mankind</h2><img alt="Biography: Mick Foley" title="Biography: Mick Foley" width=2048 height=1152 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/biography-mick-foley-2048x1152-primary-16x9-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Mick Foley as Mankind;</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foley's shot at the big stage of WWE came with the mandate that he assume the new persona of a masked character. He eventually embraced the challenge to become the distinct and disturbing figure of Mankind, a tormented soul who lived in a boiler room, confided in his pet rat, George, and delivered the throat-stuffing move known as the "Mandible Claw."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This characterization made Mankind the perfect opponent for the Undertaker, a giant who also trafficked in the dark side of human nature, and both enjoyed the boost provided by their "Boiler Room Brawl" and "Buried Alive" matches, though Foley again seemingly went too far when his body was nearly broken by the falls sustained at their 1998 "Hell in a Cell" showdown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The wrestler bounced back with a reinvented version of Mankind, this one a more likable lug who carried around a sock puppet named Mr. Socko. His matches were still marked by grotesque moments – the Mandible Claw was now administered with Mr. Socko on his hand – but Mankind surprisingly became a fan favorite on par with top draws like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/shawn-michaels data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shawn Michaels" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Shawn Michaels</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/stone-cold-steve-austin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Stone Cold" Steve Austin' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>. He began his off-and-on-again run as WWE champion by defeating <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/dwayne-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Rock" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Rock</a> in December 1998, and soon joined his fellow WWE Hall of Famer to form the successful Rock 'n' Sock Connection.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Dude Love</h2><img alt="Mick Foley in 2019 wearing a tie-dye shirt like his character, Dude Love" title="Mick Foley in 2019 wearing a tie-dye shirt like his character, Dude Love" width=3057 height=4586 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1179115057.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Mick Foley in 2019 wearing a tie-dye shirt like his character, Dude Love; Photo: Jerod Harris/Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The least-used of Foley's major character creations also happened to be his first. The gregarious, happy-go-lucky Dude Love was spawned back when an underage Foley was still horsing around in backyard wrestling videos with his buddies, the legend captured in a film short from 1985 called The Loved One. The WWE version of Dude Love surfaced a dozen years later, following a series of promotional interviews in which an anguished Mankind revealed his dashed childhood dreams, and the emergence of the dancing, goofy hippie gave the wrestler another platform to showcase his unique theatrical chops.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Dude Love's run was short-lived, the character provided a fun counterbalance to the no-nonsense intensity of Austin for several memorable matches and ultimately aided Foley's ascent to the top of the WWE pecking order.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mick Foley</h2><img alt="Mick Foley wrestling as himself in 2004" title="Mick Foley wrestling as himself in 2004" width=3000 height=2247 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-83836917.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Mick Foley wrestling as himself in 2004; Photo: KMazur/WireImage</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, after years of absorbing painful bumps and brutal beatings in other guises, Foley had garnered enough artistic freedom and audience goodwill to perform under his real name in the 2000s. In one sense, Mick Foley the wrestler simply brought his previous characters together beneath the ring garb of an everyman flannel shirt. This was best exemplified by his WrestleMania 22 match against Edge, in which the Hardcore Legend brandished one of Mankind's socks wrapped in the barbed wire favored by Cactus Jack.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the promotion of the Foley name also enabled him to make the successful transition to elder statesman and authority figure as WWE commissioner, broadcaster and RAW general manager, an incarnation that kept the popular champion in the spotlight even after his oft-battered body signaled that it was time to ease off the body-slams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46moJyjXZu8rbHYZpqhmaKWsLWx0aw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thedissrapper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Thedissrapper>&larr;
