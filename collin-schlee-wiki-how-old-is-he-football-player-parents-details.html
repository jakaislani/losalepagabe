Since 2020, the #19 junior footballer has played for Kent State. We’ll most likely see him in action on Saturday (September 24) when his squad takes on the Georgia Bulldogs at Sanford Stadium.</p><h2>Collin Schlee Wiki And Age: How Old Is He?</h2><p><strong>Collin Schlee</strong> was born in Ijamsville, Maryland, in the United States. In his hometown, he attended Oakdale High School. He was a two-sport standout who got Division I basketball scholarship offers. Collin redshirted his first year at Kent State in 2019, then filled in for Dustin Crum for the next two seasons.</p><p>He is a 3-star recruit from the class of 2019 with a composite score of 0.8138 from 247 Sports. The website ranks him 2153rd overall, 81st in pro-style QB, and 31st in Maryland. Robbert Morris, New Hampshire, Delaware State, and Kent State all made offers to the young player.&nbsp;He eventually committed to Kent State on August 7, 2018, and signed a letter of intent later that month. He has yet to enroll. Collin has played well in limited time at quarterback and was on the field alongside Dustin last season, providing opponents with a solid look. He has 508 passing yards (tied-96th), 3 passing touchdowns (92nd), 2 interceptions (tied-51st), and a 91.7 quarterback rating (6th) this season.&nbsp;Collin made his first college start versus Washington, tossing a touchdown pass of 47 yards and running for 47 yards on eight rushes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Collin-Schlee-2.jpg alt="Collin Schlee" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Collin Schlee Height: How Tall Is the Kent State QB?</h2><p>Collin Schlee has never stated his age or date of birth. Based on his Class (2019), we may estimate that he is between the ages of 19 and 22. On May 30, he turns 30 years old.&nbsp;Collin is 6 feet 3 inches tall (190 cm) and weighs 213 pounds (98 kg). He is long and powerful, with a barrel chest and a physique that can play many positions on a football field. He works hard with football performance coach Jeff Sobol and head coach Sean Lewis, and he is physically prepared to play when the time arrives.</p><p>Collin is a dual-threat quarterback with exceptional athleticism. When he runs, he seems speedy and decisive.&nbsp;Collin’s coach has said that he does a fantastic job of seizing the reins and leading in his own unique way. He said, “God has blessed me with a fantastic skill set, with my size, strength, and ability to run,” and he is satisfied with his progress.&nbsp;Collin’s arm power also allows him to make every pass required to play elite-level collegiate football.</p><h2>Collin Schlee’s Parents AreVery Supportive</h2><p>Collin Schlee is the son of Chris and Charmom Schlee. Their wedding anniversary is November 29th, and they have been married for 26 years. They have an older son called Cory Schlee as well. Chris teaches FOT and FOCS CTE at Oakdale High School in Maryland.&nbsp;His parents are very supportive of his work and often accompany him to games.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Collin-Schlee-1.jpg alt="Collin Schlee" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chris looks to be a proud father who believes in his son’s abilities. He has said that he has seen his son destroy children with his passes. He believes Collin is so quick that his opponents are unprepared.&nbsp;Chris has been playing catch with Collin since he was two years old. Furthermore, he routinely shares updates on Collin’s game and is always full of love and encouragement for his kid.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaqKScnrtuv8Kho56dXay2rLWMoaawZZ%2BhsW610mafnmWWpLy1rsClo2aonJbGpr6MqZirnZ6pwG6wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ferruccio-lamborghini.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ferruccio Lamborghini">&larr;
