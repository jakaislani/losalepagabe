It’s a question that has intrigued followers of the actor, given his reserved nature when it comes to personal matters.</p><p>Kohli’s career has been a journey marked by significant milestones, from his early education at Northolt High School to his media studies at Uxbridge College. In 2006, he further honed his skills by training with the Questors Theatre company, setting the stage for a promising acting career.</p><p>His breakthrough came when he was cast in the lead role of Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti in “iZombie.” This character became synonymous with Kohli, and he appeared in all 71 episodes of the show. His impeccable acting earned him a dedicated fan base.</p><p>Beyond “iZombie,” Kohli’s talent shone in various other projects, including the 2018 film “Happy Anniversary,” the TV series “Supergirl,” and his voice work in animated series like “Harley Quinn.” His portrayal of Owen Sharma in “The Haunting of Bly Manor” and Sheriff Hassan in “Midnight Mass” further showcased his acting prowess and versatility.</p><p>While his professional life has been under the spotlight, his personal life remains somewhat enigmatic. In July 2018, he announced his engagement to Yasmin Molloy, a revelation that piqued the curiosity of fans who wanted to learn more about the woman who briefly held his heart. However, their engagement eventually ended, and Yasmin Molloy is now referred to as Rahul Kohli’s ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Kohli is known for his active presence on Twitter, his unwavering support for the Liverpool FC football team, and his passion for gaming. His commitment to using both he/him and they/them pronouns, despite being cisgender, has made him an advocate for normalizing gender-neutral pronouns.</p><p>The question of whether Rahul Kohli has children remains unanswered in the public domain. As he continues to impress audiences with his acting prowess and make strides in the entertainment industry, his personal life remains a topic of intrigue and respect for privacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqRncKtecqon6WhXZi1qrjDq5ynZZSksrR50ZqfrqRdoLypuMhmn5qulWK4qrDSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./snoop-dogg-cereal-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Snoop Dogg Is Launching a Cereal Called Snoop Loopz, Naturally">&larr;
