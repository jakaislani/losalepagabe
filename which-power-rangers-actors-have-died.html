Despite its cheap origins, however, Power Rangers has definitively proven itself to be a bastion of pop culture, having endured in various forms over the decades ⁠– reaching from 1993’s beloved Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to the latest edition, <a href=#>Power Rangers: Cosmic Fury</a>.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>So many actors have come and gone with each new ensemble cast that’s introduced to this universe. Every so often, the Power Rangers universe has unfortunately suffered its fair share of losses. Several key players who made a lasting impact on fans across the years — whether they played heroes, villains, or scene-stealing supporting characters — have passed away.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>As we remember those the Power Rangers franchise has lost, it’s worth bearing in mind one of the superhero team’s creeds: “Once a Ranger, always a Ranger…”</p><h2 id=h-robert-l-manahan data-injectable=false>Robert L.

Manahan voiced the Rangers’ floaty-headed mentor that was Zordon in the original Mighty Morphin series (after assuming the role from David Fielding, who played him in the first season), as well as in the follow-up Power Rangers series Zeo, Turbo, and In Space, respectively.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Since the late 1970s, prior to his work in the Power Rangers universe, Manahan had been doing voice-over and behind-the-scenes audio production on countless TV and film projects. Manahan died in 2000 from a heart aneurysm at the age of 43. To honor him, an episode of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, “The Fifth Crystal,” was dedicated to his memory.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Thuy Trang</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>For many years, the most prominent loss of a Power Rangers cast member was Thuy Trang, who played Trini Kwan, the very first Yellow Ranger, in the first two seasons of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. After she left the show in the middle of the series’ second season, Trang would go on to eventually appear on the big screen in the film Spy Hard (1996), and in The Crow: City of Angels (1996).</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Trang tragically died in a car crash in 2001</a>, at just 27 years old.

In dedication to her memory, footage of Soga as Magiel was used to depict a reformed Rita Repulsa in the two-part final episode of Power Rangers: Mystic Force, titled “Mystic Fate”.
