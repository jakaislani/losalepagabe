Follow to know more about Tina and her journey in the show.</strong></p><p>Bling Empire, a popular <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Netflix</strong></a> series, provides viewers with an inside peek into the personal and business lives of super-rich Asians in Los Angeles. The individuals in the group are self-made, financially independent company owners, philanthropists, and entrepreneurs. Given the popularity of Bling Empire, it’s hardly surprising that Netflix decided to create <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bling Empire: New York</strong></a>, with Season 2 alum <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Dorothy Wang</strong></a> moving to the Empire State from Los Angeles.</p><p>Like the original series, the cast is comprised of billionaires, influencers, and business people attempting to navigate New York City while maintaining friendships and relationships along with <strong>Lynn Ban</strong>, <strong>Blake Abbie</strong>, <strong>Stephen Hung</strong>, <strong>Deborah Valdez-Hung</strong>, <strong>Richard Chang</strong>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Vika</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tina Leung</strong></a> as series regulars.</p><p>Tina, a fashionista who is always found in the front row at fashion week, has lived in New York for quite some time. And currently, fans are excited to meet the NY cast and get a glimpse into her life. Likely, many people have also been curious to know her Instagram handle. And if you are looking for the same, follow the article to learn more!</p><h2>Tina Leung From Bling Empire: She Has Over 398K Followers on Instagram & Has Collaborated With High-End Labels Such as Gucci and Roberto Cavalli!</h2><p><strong>Tina Leung</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@tinaleung</a>) (born on March 27, 1982) is a Hong Kong-born fashion blogger and stylist who grew up in Orange County, California to allegedly traditional Chinese parents. Meanwhile, she is known as the fashion “It” girl for a reason. She effortlessly pulls off a fashionable look and her fashion sense is unsurprising given her background as a model, blogger, and stylist who frequently appears in high-fashion editorials. Currently, she has over 398k followers on Instagram.</p><p>The 40-year-old influencer has worked with brands such as Valentino, Prada, Chanel, and Loewe because of her incredible talents. As one of the most well-connected influencers, the Netflix star is frequently spotted at fashion weeks around the world. She has front-row seats at many designer presentations, so there is no doubt about the respect she has earned over the years.</p><p>She earned a degree in drama from the University of Bristol in 2004 before deciding to pursue a career in fashion. Not long after, she re-enrolled in college to earn a styling certificate from the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York City, according to Bustle. Tina returned to Hong Kong after earning her styling certificate in New York, where she worked as a stylist and writer for Prestige Magazine.</p><p>Tina eventually returned to New York, and her career as a fashion influencer took off from there. She now has over <strong>394,000</strong> Instagram followers and has collaborated with high-end labels such as Gucci, and Roberto Cavalli.</p><p>Even though Tina refers to herself as an influencer on-camera, she prefers to describe her work differently, according to Fashionista. She <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>. “I’m trying to curate my title. I don’t really have a filter on my mouth.”</p><h2>Is Tina Leung Dating Anyone?</h2><p><strong>Tina Leung</strong> is currently <a href=# rel=noopener>single</a> and working hard to heal her past familial and relationship traumas to the best of her abilities, based on her online footprints. Her family dynamic did, admittedly, influence how she views love, but so did her previous toxic romances, as evidenced by her panic attack when her friends tried to set her up with someone.</p><p>In fact, despite the fact that they were in a very social setting and the men were nothing but friendly, the otherwise fierce fashionista felt preyed upon; their attention triggered her. In terms of dating history, Tina writes on Bling Empire,</p><p><strong>I had a boyfriend for two years and then straight into a seven-year relationship… Every year and a half, [the latter] broke up with me, and I returned. He had brief liaisons with other women. He had some comments about my weight. For example, during our summers together, he only allowed me to eat one bowl of cereal per day. He claimed he was attempting to assist me in achieving the weight I desired. But if he found out I ate something, we’d have a huge fight. My previous relationships were all bad. To be honest, none of them have been kind to me.</strong></p><p>Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Tina typically prefers to keep her extremely private and personal experiences out of the public eye. This means that she probably won’t disclose anything unless she’s engaged in a meaningful, fulfilling relationship.</p><p><strong>Check out <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKyZo65ustGopGaanJ67qHnEpqeiqpVitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-hidetaka-miyazaki-make-latest-hidetaka-miyazaki-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Hidetaka Miyazaki Make?
