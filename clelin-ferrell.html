Ferrell was put on injured reserve on December 30, 2020. Through 11 games, he concluded the season with 27 tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles.</li><li>Ferrell’s fifth-year option was not exercised by the Raiders on April 29, 2022, meaning he will be a free agent in the 2023 offseason.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Clelin-Ferrell-2-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Clelin Ferrell’s Net Worth</h2><p>The NFL has a profitable profession, and Clelin Ferrell is a well-known NFL player.
