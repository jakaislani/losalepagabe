Learn the truth about his sexual orientation, relationship, and partner.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The American model, actor, and skateboarder is most known for his role as Aki in the HBO Max series Gossip Girl. Evan has modeled for prestigious firms such as Louis Vuitton and 1017 Alyx 9SM and has his clothing line, Sorry in Advance.</p><h2><span id=Is_Evan_Mock_Gay_or_Straight>Is Evan Mock Gay or Straight?</span></h2><p>Evan Mock is heterosexual, not gay. Evan, despite playing a guy who is discovering his sexuality in the Gossip Girl series, is straight. He plays Akeno “Aki” Menzies, a bisexual private school student who adores skating and movies, in the 2021 Drama series. Aki is Obie’s (Eli Brown) best friend, and Max (Thomas Doherty) is Audrey’s (Emily Alyn Lind) boyfriend.</p><p>Evan makes his acting debut in the HBO Max teenage Drama series, which premieres in July 2021. The character of Evan was created by the show’s creator, Joshua Safran. People frequently misread his demeanor and appearance, notably his distinctive pink hair, as proof of his homosexuality.</p><p>Evan revealed to Mr. Porter what he discovered about his sexuality while filming intimate sequences with his male co-star. Aki and his fiancée (Aubrey) were both madly in love with the same person, Max, and they created a trio. Evan believed kissing a guy was weird and attributed it to “social norms and all that.” Furthermore, even though he is not homosexual in real life, he stated that his character is bisexual. Another difficulty was to kiss my co-star in the film, Thomas Doherty.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Evan_Mocks_Girlfriend_Relationship_Timeline>Who Is Evan Mock’s Girlfriend? Relationship Timeline</span></h2><p>Evan Mock revealed to Mr. Porter Magazine in 2021 that he had been dating his girlfriend, Gray Sorrenti, for about a year. She is claimed to be a photographer and a Manhattan socialite. The couple lives in New York. However, because he is extremely secretive, he refuses to reveal any additional details about his partner or connection.</p><p>But things haven’t always gone smoothly for him in the love department. He earlier stated to Monster Children that if he could change one aspect of his life, it would be to erase the memory of being dumped. He expressed a desire to forget about his high school girlfriend cheating on him with his “so-called friend.” “People think that’s healthy to experience [a heartbreak] at least once in your life, but I’m calling bullshit on that,” Evan stated.</p><h2><span id=Evan_Mocks_Parents_And_Family>Evan Mock’s Parents And Family</span></h2><p>Evan Mock was born in the Hawaiian town of Waimea Bay on the island of Oahu. Because of his American father and Filipino mother, he is of mixed nationality and ethnicity. Steve Mock, his father, is a surfboard fin manufacturer, and Melissa Mock, his mother, is a stay-at-home mom. Evan is the middle kid of a family that includes an older sister, Alana Spencer, and a younger brother.</p><p>He was born on April 8, 1997, under the sign of Aries. Evan grew up homeschooled and aspired to be a professional surfer or skater. He relocated to California at the age of 18 to pursue a professional skateboarding career after growing up in Hawaii. He became famous because musician Frank Ocean tweeted a video of him skating.</p><p>Evan walked the runways for 1017 Alyx 9SM and Louis Vuitton before establishing his clothing line, Sorry in Advance, in 2019. He has also worked with Aldo Group, Paco Rabanne, and Giuseppe Zanotti, and he will launch a line with RVCA in June 2021. Evan presently resides in both his native Oahu and New York City.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
