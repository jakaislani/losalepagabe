According to it, she began her professional career in 2011 as a law clerk, which lasted less than a year.</p><p>She then made a jump to be a Contract Attorney for the U.S. Department of State in 2011 for approximately a year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 2012, Ellis moved back to her native state of Colorado and started working as a Deputy District Attorney, which too&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;last for more than a year.&nbsp;</p><p>In the subsequent year, she began her private practice as Attorney At Law, while&nbsp;also becoming&nbsp;an assistant professor of Legal Studies at the Colorado Christian University from 2015 through 2018.</p><p>The year 2018 presented her with the opportunity to&nbsp;become&nbsp;the DIrector of Dobson Policy Center at the James Dobson Family Institute — a post&nbsp;she held for a year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Midway through her tenure at CCU, she also started writing for the Beltway Confidential Blog in Washington Examiner — a position that she has held since 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>How Much is Jenna Ellis’s Net Worth?</h2><p>It is imperative&nbsp;to note that Ellis has never revealed how much she got paid during any of her jobs. However, we can look at the available data regarding how much the average salary is for these positions and jobs.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Indeed </a>reports that a law clerk receives an average of $67,815 per year as of October 2020. However, as Ellis held the position a long time ago, she might have received a little less than the current average.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Indeed</a>, her job as a Contract Attorney at the U.S. Department of State should have paid her somewhere around $146,232 a year, which happens to be 60 percent above the national salary average in the US.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Moving on to her job as a Deputy District Attorney, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glassdoor </a>reports that the position pays $166,339 on average per annum as of June 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Being a professor might be the least paying job she has done to date. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glassdoor</a>, her job as an Assistant Professor of Legal Studies at CCU might have paid her somewhere around $80,738 per year. Ellis held the teaching position from 2015 to 2018, but since the given data is from 2013, it can be inferred that her earnings were higher than the stipulated amount.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Private law practices are also a very high-paying business. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zip Recruiter</a>’s data shows that a Constitutional lawyer gets paid around $88,139 in a year on average, with the lowest dropping to $24,000 and the highest income climbing to a whopping $216,500. A look at her expertise and experience would suggest that she is, most probably, getting paid more than the average. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Finally, we arrive at the job on focus here. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glassdoor</a>&nbsp;suggests that a Senior Legal Advisor gets paid around $129,380 on average per year. However, it might not be an overstatement to say that Ellis might be getting paid a lot more than that considering the wealth of the candidate she is rooting for, President Donald Trump.</p><p>All these suggest that Ellis’s net worth could be upward of a million dollars, but that is just an assumption on our part. We will have to wait for a credible financial source to review her financial standings before jumping to any particular figure.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Jenna Ellis also Makes a Few Bucks from Her Book Sales</h2><p>Jenna Ellis’s book, “The Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution: A Guide for Christians to Understand America’s Constitutional Crisis,” was released on <span>December 22, 2015</span><strong><span>.</span></strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 244-pages-long book can be bought from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>. The Kindle version of the book costs $5.99, the hardcover version costs $35.95, and the illustrated paperback version of the book is on sale for $19.95.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Amazon has not revealed how many books have been sold from the site since its release. However, there are a few rankings available. Ellis’s book ranks in the 542,655th position in the Best Sellers Rank, and 850th position in the General Constitutional Law books rank.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Byr7rAZpylpJmowG66xK1ksKeiqbVvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./russell-simmons-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Russell Simmons Net Worth: Books &amp;amp; Career">&larr;
