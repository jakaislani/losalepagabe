They have been in a husband and wife relationship for quite a long time, but the pair have not given any hint regarding their marriage.</p><p>The pair mainly prefers to keep their life away from the public platforms as they are highly aware of their privacy and do not want to get involved in unwanted controversies. Due to their lowkey nature, we cannot cover many details about their love life.</p><p>However, we can say that they are a powerful couple who have supported each other in every step of their life. There is no sign of separating them, so we can say that Debbie and Steve still lead happy life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steve-sax-wife-is-sad-after-son-john-sax-crash-death></span>Steve Sax Wife Is Sad After Son John Sax Crash Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the moment, Steve Sax and his wife, Debbie Graham, both are devasted by the death of their beloved son, John Sax. Their son was one of five Marines killed during a training exercise on Wednesday.</p><p>John was 33 years old at the time of his death. He had always&nbsp;dreamed&nbsp;of being a pilot. Steve’s son was among the aircrew of an Osprey tiltrotor aircraft that proceeded down during training in a remote place in Imperial County, east of San Diego and about 50 miles from Yuma, Arizona.</p><p>Cpl. Nathan E. Carlson, Capt. Nicholas P. Losapio,Cpl. Seth D. Rasmuson, and Lance Cpl. Evan A. Strickland was the other crew member who lost their life. So, the whole world is paying tribute to all these late souls.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=debbie-sax-has-two-children></span>Debbie Sax Has Two Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Together with her husband, Debbie Sax is blessed with two children, John Sax, and Lauren Ashley Bliss. Recently, Jon passed away and is&nbsp;survived&nbsp;by his wife, Amber. John had a 20-month-old daughter.</p><p>And Amber was pregnant with their second child. Apart from that, Debbie’s daughter appears to be a married lady, but there is very little info about them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ydnJuamZp6qL7AoZimZaOpsrexjKyYsWWnnrOmecisZKGdkafBo77OpJynZZGbwaa%2BjKymp2WapLWvedKar2abopbAqXnApaann12strW0jKycr52ilrluu9OhnKurXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bio-boyfriend-height-net-worth-and-career-of-liv-shumbres.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bio, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth And Career Of Liv Shumbres">&larr;
