Like all of the professionals I was to meet who worked with disfigurement, he had a warm bedside manner and discussed my problems in a matter-of-fact way. He had seen worse. Much could be done. When I was on my feet he had me come to his clinic at the University for some 3D photos that would give him more to work on. Also as a reference was a bust sculpted by a friend as an assignment in art school:</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/leading-with-my-chin/06-roger-ebert-cancer-0310-lg-22880477-thumb-275x351-30667.jpg width=275 height=351 alt=06-roger-ebert-cancer-0310-lg-22880477.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>That was the beginning of a two-year process that has now resulted with my coming into possession of a silicone prosthesis. Dr. Reisberg brought in David Rotter, also from the University of Illinois, and he involved Julie Jordan Brown, a Milwaukee artist and anaplastologist. Working from molds, they created a prototype prosthesis and sculpted it carefully to more closely resemble what had been there before. This device would fit over my lower face and neck and, colored to match my skin, would pass muster at a certain distance.</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/leading-with-my-chin/_20_20_20_20julie-thumb-325x243-30841.jpg width=325 height=243 alt=" julie.jpg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>It was a problem finding the right material. Two original models were too stiff, so that my head held upright reminded me of Erich von Stroheim in "<a href=#>Grand Illusion</a>." I couldn't look down easily, which was a problem for walking and typing. Two weeks ago, David was back with a softer silicone that was much more wearable. Since I'd last met him he'd been in Haiti and Guatemala fitting false limbs for children who had lost arms or legs in natural calamities. My problems are small potatoes. David snapped the photo below after the fitting, and before the final coloring had been completed. I'd say he and Julie did a pretty wonderful damn job. I like my new prothesis and know from observation their work was painstaking and done with love and care.</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/leading-with-my-chin/_20_20_20_20_20_20nre_20rotter-thumb-285x320-30848.jpg width=285 height=320 alt=" nre rotter.jpg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>I will wear the prosthesis on the new television show. That's not to fool anyone, because my appearance is widely known. It will be used in a medium shot of me working in my office, and will be a pleasant reminder of the person I was for 64 years. Symbolically, it's as if my illness never happened and, hey, here I still am, on the show with these new kids. When people see the "Roger's Office" segment, they'll notice my voice more than my appearance.</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/leading-with-my-chin/IMG_0988-thumb-275x206-30670.jpg width=275 height=206 alt=IMG_0988.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>At the beginning of this process I assumed I would wear the new prosthesis whenever I left the house, so that "nobody would know." But everybody knows. The photograph of me that appeared in Esquire even found its way onto billboards in China. And something else has happened since that day in the hospital: I accept the way I look. Lord knows I paid the dues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq6eXmr9uscGeqa1nnJqupbXNoGSwoaSdeq7FjJyfoqY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./events.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Simple Feel Good Book Tour!">&larr;
