The show, which debuted its season finale Sunday night—and seemingly sealed Ashtray's fate—was Walton's first TV gig.</span></span><h2>Are Ashtray and Fez siblings?</h2>Perhaps the bleakest storyline of all revolves around the fate of Ashtray (Javon Walton), the ruthless adopted little brother of everyone's favorite lovable dug dealer Fezco (Angus Cloud).<h2>Are Fezco and Ashtray related?</h2>In an interview with Refinery29, Angus Cloud revealed that Ashtray is not related to Fezco by blood. Ashtray currently possess the highest killing count in the show, murdering total of three people. Ashtray is currently the only youngest victim to be killed off in the show, being 14 years old at the time of his death.<h2>Are Fez and Ashtray blood brothers?</h2>In an interview with Refinery29, Angus Cloud revealed that Fezco and Ashtray are not related by blood.<h2>Who is ashtrays brother?</h2>Whaaat, there are two "Ashtrays"? That was the question on the minds of many Euphoria fans who have Googled Javon "Wanna" Walton, the 15-year-old actor who played Fezco's little bro on the most recent second season of the HBO series, and discovered that the teen has a twin brother, Jaden Walton.<h2>euphoria | all Ashtray scenes</h2><p></p><h2>How did Ashtray become Fez brother?</h2>In Episode 1, it was revealed that, as a baby, Ash was dropped off at Fez's grandmother's (Kathrine Narducci) house, and his birth mother and father never returned. As a result, the tot was raised as Fez's brother and after his grandmother died, Fez raised Ash alone.<h2>Is Ashtray related to Nate?</h2>1. Nate's Brother Is Ashtray. If you take a closer look at the family portrait, the younger brother does closely resemble Ashtray (Javon Walton), Fez's (Angus Cloud) younger brother.<h2>Is Ashtray mute Euphoria?</h2>Javon Walton on his silent 'Euphoria' exit<p>Euphoria's season 2 finale ends with Ashtray's death, with the character's storyline coming to a dramatic—and silent—end. In the episode, Ashtray never speaks, a choice made by Euphoria director Sam Levinson.</p><h2>How did Ashtray and Fezco meet?</h2>The grandmother advised little Fez to never fall in love, as that is the only instinct one truly cannot trust. Though it was impossible to guess, Fez was good at school, especially in math. One day, as he returned home, his grandmother introduced him to little Ashtray.<h2>Is Ash Fezco brother?</h2>In Euphoria, HBO's prestige-y portrait of Gen Z, Walton plays the hyper-witted Ashtray, the adopted younger brother of Angus Cloud's Fezco. The show, which debuted its season finale Sunday night—and seemingly sealed Ashtray's fate—was Walton's first TV gig.<h2>Is Ashtray Laurie's son?</h2>Even if Fez doesn't know that Laurie is Ashtray's mother, Laurie may know that Ashtray is her son. In fact, it may be the reason why Laurie is keen to trust Fez in the first place: She knows that Fez took good care of Ashtray, and therefore is willing to deal with someone as young as Fez.<h2>Did Ashtray shoot Fez?</h2>As for Ash accidentally shooting Fez while firing at the police, Javon revealed that that wasn't part of the script at first either. Not only that but the entire police raid scene was written just one day before it was filmed.<h2>Is Ashtray a twin?</h2>Modern-day Ashtray is played by 15-year-old actor Javon Walton, and fans have just discovered that Javon's real-life little brother, Daelo Jin Walton, actually plays the young Ashtray we see in flashback scenes. Plus, viewers have found pictures of them together IRL, and they're so sweet.<h2>How old was Ashtray in season 2?</h2>The character of Ashtray is played by Javon Walton and the actor is 15-years-old, whereas the character is 14.<h2>Who is the 3rd child in Euphoria?</h2>Fans first noticed the third Jacobs sibling in season 1 of Euphoria. The family portrait features three young boys: Nate (Jacob Elordi) when he's 11-years-old and his older brother Aaron (Zak Steiner). But there's never an explanation for the third sibling, who appears to be younger than Nate in the photo.<h2>Does Nate have 2 brothers in Euphoria?</h2>Does Nate Jacobs Have Siblings on "Euphoria"? So, what else does the photo tell us? Well, Nate has two brothers.<h2>How old was Ashtray when he met Fez?</h2>Fans first met Ashtray in season 1 when he was about 11 years old, and they discovered that he had been abandoned by his mother at a very young age. He was initially raised by Fezco's grandmother, but after she fell ill, he was raised by Fezco (played by Angus Cloud) himself.<h2>Does Nate Jacobs have a brother?</h2>Aaron was born to Marsha and Cal Jacobs and is Nate's older brother.<h2>How old is Fez's little brother?</h2>Javon Walton is 15 years old. He was born on 23 July, 2006.<h2>Are Jaden and Javon twins?</h2>Javon and Jaden Walton<p>The teen Euphoria star, who played Ashtray on the first two seasons, has a fraternal twin brother named Jaden.</p><h2>Why did Ashtray get killed off?</h2>“But there's been a few times like that, where Ashtray was supposed to have certain dialogue and Sam just decided to cut it because he likes [that with] Ashtray, there's a lot of mystery behind him,” he explained.<h2>Why did Ashtray lock himself in the bathroom?</h2>Fez pleads with Ashtray to let him take the fall because they know the police are literally on their way. Ashtray refuses, and he grabs a bunch of guns and barricades himself in the bathroom. The FBI enter the home and there's a shootout between the FBI officers and Ashtray, who's hiding in the bathtub.<h2>Does Fez get killed in Euphoria?</h2>Fez gets shot in the stomach in the crossfire before watching one of the red dots land on Ashtray's forehead. And though viewers hear the gunshot and see Fez's anguished face, Euphoria doesn't explicitly show Ashtray's death.<h2>Does Cal have 3 sons in Euphoria?</h2>In the very first episode, we're shown an old family portrait of Cal, Marsha and their sons: Aaron, Nate and a mystery third boy. The portrait appears again in episode 2 and, most recently, during Cal's seven-minute monologue in season 2.<h2>What happened to Fez and Ashtray?</h2>Unfortunately, and inexplicably, the young kid instead locks himself in the bathroom with all the guns he has in the house for one final stand-off. Ashtray ends up shooting a police officer, Fezco gets caught in the middle, and Ashtray then gets shot and killed himself.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZJqrmKm%2FosWMn5yzZZKnvLW0xKs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./real-housewives-thailand-cast-every-star-appearing-in-ultimate-girls-trip-season-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Real Housewives Thailand cast: Every star appearing in Ultimate Girls Trip season 3">&larr;
